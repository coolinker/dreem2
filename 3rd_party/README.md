--- Notes ---
Dreem2 uses websockets so we need to use phantomjs 2 for testing since that is the first version that supports websockets.

There is an issue getting the official version of phantomJS 2 to run correctly on OSX 10.10 so we need to use a forked version until the issue is resolved. 

The version I've checked in here was pulled from: https://github.com/eugene1g/phantomjs/releases

Another options is if you have upx you can just re-unpack the official binary (i.e. 'upx -d phantomjs-2.0.0-macosx/bin/phantomjsâ€™) and it seems to work.

--- Installation ---
To install this version:

1) Unzip it.
2) Figure out where your phantomjs is installed
    > which phantomjs
3) Backup your existing phantomjs from /usr/local/bin/phantomjs or whereever yours was found.
4) Copy the new one to /usr/local/bin/phantomjs or whereever yours was found.
5) Verify the version by typing:
    > phantomjs -v

--- Todo ---
Once these issues are resolved we should remove this from our repo.
